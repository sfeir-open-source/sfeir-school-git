# Slides

You can view the slides [here](https://sfeir-open-source.github.io/sfeir-school-git/).

## Develop

To run docs locally, go in directory `docs` and run `npx serve` of if you don't have node, you can use docker `docker-compose up`, and open slides on http://localhost:5000/.

## Workshop

Workshops are in directory `steps` :
* two directories per workshop :
  * one with a README.md with workshop steps and source file to complete
  * a second directory suffixed with `-solution` which contains source file with solutions.
